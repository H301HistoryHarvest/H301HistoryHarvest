## Network Analysis to Understand an Object's Sentimentality in Context

How do connections between an object and its context affect the sentimentality between a person and an object?

Our items all inspire a sense of sentimentality from the contributors. Some have a cultural connection, like the kimono and baby blankets, while others are more related to individual expresssion and family ties like the cleats and Gorn painting, respectively. Our network is allowing us to see how objects originating from different cultures find their way to a specific location. 


## Using Network Analysis to Understand how Sentimentality affects Objects and their Cultures

![Our "Blackboard Model"](/H301HistoryHarvest/assets/images/Blackboard_Model.jpeg){:width="250px"}

We created a base model (shown above) as to how we were going to link our objects, their contributors, and their significance together, and see how they would all connect to a larger sense of community here at Indiana University. Using this model, we were able to see how seemingly different objects all came together here at Indiana University, from their different cultural backgrounds and different locations around the world. This led us to divide our objects based on their cultural context, individuality, and/or location of origin. Not all of the objects fell into all three of the catagories, some only fell into one.

In the secondary sources for the baby blankets, the way immigrants, among other established groups in the U.S., establish community is discussed. The connected objects can show different manners in which people establish community, as many of the objects are tied to family, community, or culture. Andrew McKevitt explains this beautifully by stating that "Historians can use examples of... foreign products and practices to draw tentative conclusions about the ways in which cultural globalization has tansformed the United States."
He further explains that people who create and embrace more "organic" ways of exploring their cultural heritage, or objects that tie them to a certain culture or community, that are free of the influence of govermental, corporate, and non-governmental organizations, have allowed the true cultural globalization of objects to find their way either to the United States themselves, or the culture itself to come to the U.S. and influence the creation of the objects here.

Several paragraphs, some of them adapted from your individual research on your objects, go here. Think about the connections from your secondary sources and how some of the other objects from our history harvest fit those connections.

## Connecting Everything to our Research Question

Network analysis allows the ability to illustrate a visual connection between an item and its correspondents, whether that is an owner, creator, or even a contextual event. The links between an item and its related nodes help to show a deeper connection, describing how an object has a significant meaning beyond its surface. By linking nodes to other nodes, one is able to see how objects that appear unrelated actually have an underlying backgrounds that tie them together. We created a model to base all objects off of, forming a connection triangle between a person, an object, and the context of the object. For our group, we did research on a painting, a kimono, a blanket, and a pair of cleats – all seemingly unrelated and mutually exclusive at first glance. However, after applying our network analysis triangle model, we were able to see the connection between objects via cultural and artistic significances. By tying our object to a context and relating that context to a person’s sentimentality, we were able to form a deeper meaning for objects and then have the ability to link objects with similar contextual values in order to build a web of inter-related connotations. This allowed us to not only interpret and connect our personally chosen objects, but see if there was a similar connection between the other items collected in the history harvest. By linking objects to each other through sentimental context and other factors, we are able to create a community of people and objects that would originally never be placed together.
