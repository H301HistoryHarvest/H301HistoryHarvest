## Network analysis to understand an object's sentimentality in context

How do connections between an object and its context affect the sentimentality between a person and an object?

Our items all inspire a sense of sentimentality from the contributors. Some have a cultural connection, like the kimono and baby blankets, while others are more related to individual expresssion and family ties like the cleats and Gorn painting, respectively. Our network is allowing us to see how objects originating from different cultures find their way to a specific location. 


## Network analysis as a way of understanding your research question

![Our "Blackboard Model"](/H301HistoryHarvest/assets/images/Blackboard_Model.jpeg){:width="250px"}

We created a base model (shown above) as to how we were going to link our objects, their contributors, and their significance together, and see how they would all connect to a larger sense of community here at Indiana University. Using this model, we were able to see how seemingly different objects all came together here at Indiana University, from their different cultural backgrounds and different locations around the world. This led us to divide our objects based on their cultural context, individuality, and/or location of origin. Not all of the objects fell into all three of the catagories, some only fell into one.

In the secondary sources for the baby blankets, the way immigrants, among other established groups in the U.S., establish community is discussed. The connected objects can show different manners in which people establish community, as many of the objects are tied to family, community, or culture. Andrew McKevitt explains this beautifully by stating that "Historians can use examples of... foreign products and practices to draw tentative conclusions about the ways in which cultural globalization has tansformed the United States."
He further explains that people who create and embrace more "organic" ways of exploring their cultural heritage, or objects that tie them to a certain culture or community, that are free of the influence of govermental, corporate, and non-governmental organizations, have allowed the true cultural globalization of objects to find their way either to the United States themselves, or the culture itself to come to the U.S. and influence the creation of the objects here.

Several paragraphs, some of them adapted from your individual research on your objects, go here. Think about the connections from your secondary sources and how some of the other objects from our history harvest fit those connections.

## A conclusion

A conclusion about how Network analysis together with the research you did on your individual objects helped you answer your research question.
Network analysis has allowed us to see how objects from different cultures, both domestic and international, come together through means of sentimentality and globalization to create both different communities and one larger, "umbrella" community. Through our created model, we were able to use Net.Create to see this structure in all of our objects, and how those "Context" nodes allowed several objects (in some cases) to...
