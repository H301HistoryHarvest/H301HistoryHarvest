## Network Analysis to Understand an Object's Sentimentality in Context

How do connections between an object and its context affect the sentimentality between a person and an object?

Our items all inspire a sense of sentimentality from the contributors. Some have a cultural connection, like the kimono and baby blankets, while others are more related to individual expresssion and family ties like the cleats and Gorn painting, respectively. Our network is allowing us to see how objects originating from different cultures find their way to a specific location. 


## Using Network Analysis to Understand how Sentimentality affects Objects and their Cultures

![Our "Blackboard Model"](/H301HistoryHarvest/assets/images/Blackboard_Model.jpeg){:width="250px"}

We created a base model (shown above) as to how we were going to link our objects, their contributors, and their significance together, and see how they would all connect to a larger sense of community here at Indiana University. Using this model, we were able to see how seemingly different objects all came together here at Indiana University, from their different cultural backgrounds and different locations around the world. This led us to divide our objects based on their cultural context, individuality, and/or location of origin. Not all of the objects fell into all three of the catagories, some only fell into one.

In the secondary sources for the baby blankets, the way immigrants, among other established groups in the U.S., establish community is discussed. The connected objects can show different manners in which people establish community, as many of the objects are tied to family, community, or culture. Andrew McKevitt explains this beautifully by stating that "Historians can use examples of... foreign products and practices to draw tentative conclusions about the ways in which cultural globalization has tansformed the United States."
He further explains that people who create and embrace more "organic" ways of exploring their cultural heritage, or objects that tie them to a certain culture or community, that are free of the influence of govermental, corporate, and non-governmental organizations, have allowed the true cultural globalization of objects to find their way either to the United States themselves, or the culture itself to come to the U.S. and influence the creation of the objects here.

Further described in one of the secondary sources for the blankets is the role immigrants play in their families, with them often caring for their children and having active roles in their lives. One way in which immigrants can have roles in their families' lives is through the giving of gifts, such as Nana's Cobija. This role is reflected even in the gifts given by non-immigrant Americans, such as the Gorn painting and Kimono. A number of nodes on the network analysis display a trend of contributed items being gifts from family members, suggesting that the relation to family is a notable factor in forming sentimentality.

Another secondary source, on the importance of black churches in their communities, established that family ties aren't needed to establish community. This is reflected in objects such as the pillow sham bag, where a local club was the source of community, and the Grateful Dead hat, where a shared love for the band created community. This latter source, fandom community, is a major influence reflected in the network analysis. With the advent of the internet, people can connect and form community in online spaces, allowing for a new outlet separate from family.

Using McKevitt's observation of cultural globalization, combined with our network analysis, we can start to see how our Blackboard Model not only shows us these connections between person, object, and context for our four objects represented on this page, but how the model tends to hold true for all the objects that we were able to collect. If we compare objects like the kimono, the marigold tattoo of Veronica's, and Taylor's Harry Potter Tattoo, we can see that they all have a different connection between the context and the object, but all three represent a bond of sentimentality that holds the person connected to the object and the context, and then some third bond that connects the object to the context. The kimono's is the bond between it, Japan, and the fact that Caitlyn and her grandfather are the only two in their family to share that experience, even though their trips to Japan were separated by two generations. Veronica's marigold tattoo's bond between the tattoo and her Latina culture is represented in the meaning behind the marigolds themselves: a flower used in their culture to guide the spirits to their respective shrine. They also have another representation of strength and survival, something that signifies another part of her journey. Lastly, if we look at the Hogwarts tattoo that Taylor allowed us to capture, we can see this connect between a love that he has had since childhood for a series that has been an escape for him, combined with his love for tattoos, and the representation of what Hogwarts means to the world of Harry Potter. You can see these connections below. The blue lines represent the connections between the person, their object, and the "context" that their object and themselves share. The red shows the background that their object either has, how it came into their possession, and/or how it gives more sentimentality to the connection between them and their object.

Several paragraphs, some of them adapted from your individual research on your objects, go here. Think about the connections from your secondary sources and how some of the other objects from our history harvest fit those connections.

The other marvel that examples like these give us is that we can "see" through our network analysis the cultural globalization that McKevitt describes. Our connections and our theory of our model allow us to see just how all these different cultures, both domestic and international, can make their way into one community. Also, we have the chance to dive into the depths as to how they made their way into not only their respective owners procession, but also into said community. We have been able to physically connect how Harry Potter, Mexican culture, and Japanese culture all made their way into Bloomington. We have been able to see how a recipes from Hawai'i and how a necklace from parents in China give such a personalized meaning to an individual, despite them being viewed as either "mass-produced" or every-day common objects.

## Connecting Everything to our Research Question

Network analysis allows the ability to illustrate a visual connection between an item and its correspondents, whether that is an owner, creator, or even a contextual event. The links between an item and its related nodes help to show a deeper connection, describing how an object has a significant meaning beyond its surface. By linking nodes to other nodes, one is able to see how objects that appear unrelated actually have an underlying backgrounds that tie them together. We created a model to base all objects off of, forming a connection triangle between a person, an object, and the context of the object. For our group, we did research on a painting, a kimono, a blanket, and a pair of cleats – all seemingly unrelated and mutually exclusive at first glance. However, after applying our network analysis triangle model, we were able to see the connection between objects via cultural and artistic significances. By tying our object to a context and relating that context to a person’s sentimentality, we were able to form a deeper meaning for objects and then have the ability to link objects with similar contextual values in order to build a web of inter-related connotations. This allowed us to not only interpret and connect our personally chosen objects, but see if there was a similar connection between the other items collected in the history harvest. By linking objects to each other through sentimental context and other factors, we are able to create a community of people and objects that would originally never be placed together.
