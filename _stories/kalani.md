Play gets a lot of attention in the world of education. Play--in the form of video games like Code Combat or Osmo's [Coding Awbie](https://www.playosmo.com/en/coding/)--helps acclimate young children to the world of computer code. In the world of history, though, it's not the play that gets attention. It's the material effects of play on adult life, on consumer culture, on military history, that dominate the history of toys. In quotidian history, of the sort that focuses on every day life and the world of history and memory, toys fade into the background. My Nanoblock Eiffel Tower offers a glimpse of this version of "toy", in which the toy provides an avatar for play, home life, and travel.

## A Local Look at Play

In the contemporary world, IUB's [game design major, offered through the media school](https://mediaschool.indiana.edu/academics/degrees/game-design/index.html) is a good example of the business of play, but it's not the only one. The [Slocum Puzzle Collection](http://www.indiana.edu/~liblilly/collections/overview/puzzles.shtml) offers a historic look at the world of play through puzzles. The exhibit offers a look at cleverly designed puzzles that range from 15th-century trick knives to 80s-era vintage Rubik's cubes. A donation from Jerry Slocum, who donated 30,000 puzzles to the library, turned one room in the Lilly into the Slocum Puzzle Room in 2006. The collection was designed not as a museum exhibit, with the puzzles rendered inaccessible behind glass, but as a puzzle library that allowed visitors to interact with, solve, and have fun with puzzles in the collection.

The items in the Slocum Room, like the Nanoblock Eiffel Tower that inspired this story, reverse the course that Game Design majors take. Where IUB's major turns play into work, the Slocum Room has a host of puzzles that turn work into play. One puzzle in particular, [The Niagara Puzzle (with File and Compass)](http://purl.dlib.indiana.edu/iudl/lilly/slocum/LL-SLO-000630) tells that story very well. It's a box-shaped puzzle that shows a drawing of a waterfall, presumably Niagara Falls (a popular tourist destination as early as the 18th century). Users are asked to get all of the little balls off of a "bank" (a small wooden piece set flat inside the puzzle at the top of the falls) into a "whirlpool", a hole at the top right corner of the box. Similar puzzles by the same manufacturer, R. Journet, were sent to British solders imprisoned in Germany during WWI with a hacksaw, a compass and a map hidden inside to facilitate their escape. 

These puzzles require manual dexterity, problem-solving skills, have application in real life--you try leveling the Eiffel Tower in miniature without thinking through the tenets of basic geometry!--and have an element of nostalgia that roots them in a particular historical context.
