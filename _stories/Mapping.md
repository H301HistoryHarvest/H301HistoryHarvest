## A catchy headline

How do material physical objects connect people to their communities? Additionally, how are the objects themselves shaped by the communities? 

Our groupâ€™s objects are all familial pieces of various cultures that reflect the lifestyle of multiple communities across the world. We intend to connect these objects, along with others, while tracking the journeys in which these objects took to arrive in our History Harvest at Indiana University. The objects that we collected are not just meaningless inanimate objects, but treasured items that truly mean something to its owner. Logging these items into our History Harvest allows for these representations of culture to become etched in society for the understanding of future generations.

## Spatial analysis as a way of understanding your research question

Several paragraphs, some of them adapted from your individual research on your objects, go here. Think about the connections from your secondary sources and how some of the other objects from our history harvest fit those connections.

Several paragraphs on the results you see from your spatial analyis so far.
