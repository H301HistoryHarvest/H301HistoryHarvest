## Research Question

How do the various descriptive patterns people use help connect people from different parts of the world?Â 

## Process of analysis

- Collection of transcripts
- Separate objects into three different groups: *Apparel, Household items and Miscellaneous*
- Group transcripts based on object groups
- Upload transcripts onto *Voyant*
- Make a list of *stop words* for each of the different groups using Voyant


## Object Groups: Apparel, Household items, Miscellaneous items

*Apparel*

*Household items*

*Miscellaneous*

The objects are divided in three different secitons: apparels, household objects, and other memiscellaneous items. 

Several paragraphs, some of them adapted from your individual research on your objects, go here. Think about the connections from your secondary sources and how some of the other objects from our history harvest fit those connections.
