## A catchy headline

A version of your research question goes here.

The Dorodango collection is a collection of mudballs that were collected by the object’s owner over the course of the past 25 years. He teaches the process of creating dorodango as an educational tool in his art classes to help his students learn how nature can be used to create art, to teach them patience, and as a means of relief and comfort. This collection relates to our research question because it is an educational tool, and through learning the student grows, and individual growth is a mode for individual expression. Additionally, because dorodango is used in education, this collection reflects the culture of education in the United States. Vans are an individual statement that J’Essence wants to include in her life on a daily basis.  These shoes bring her some kind of luck she says whenever she wears them.  She relates to how good her days usually are, and on that day when she brought them to the history harvest, she felt that her day was going very well.  When looking at when she purchased the show, she felt that she had a connection to the shoe right from the store.  These shoes are very vibrant with color and have many pops apart of them.  I think they add something that some individuals may feel nervous about now-a-days, which is individual expression, especially when it comes that what they are wearing on a daily basis. J’Essence is a leader in this and really looks to keep her style going, whichever way she feels lucky. The Tribal Drawing that the owner plans on getting into a tattoo shows the cultural and historical value of the owners family and heritage through a form of individual self expression. It connects him to his Polynesian roots which is a big aspect of his life. Also, tattoos and other forms of body art are a big source of self expression because it lets you know more about a person through a visual cue.

## Network analysis as a way of understanding your research question

Were to define nodes as objects, locations, and tags, and our edges are defined as "is connected to..." Of the information we had available, selecting these as our nodes and identifying the edges as "is connected to..." made the most sense organizationally. By doing this, we hoped that the connections between the objects and the tags would be clearly illustrated. Our method was for each group member to focus on one item at a time, create a node for that item, create nodes for tags and locations relating to that item, and then connect that item to those nodes. Once each member added all of the tags and locations for the object and connected them via edges, we moved on to the next object on the list.

From the secondary sources, we are finding more to add in our networking then we initially thought we would have.  When thinking about it, it can be hard to correlate something to Vans or Mudballs.  When thinking about it in the big picture however, we found that adding smaller items that can relate, would help us better understand how uncorrelated items even come together at times.  The Vans that were chosen by one of our group members, was hard to connect with something.  When looking deeper, we looked at how Candy Stripe pants tied into having that no name pattern like the Vans, but still having a stronger meaning.  Even though they aren’t even similar on the same spectrum, we looked at how these two were similar in a way that could be tied together.

Several paragraphs on the results you see from your Network analysis so far.
So far, the network is completely centered around individual expression. The secondary center however is cultural value. These two tags serve as the core between the items. As more items get entered, the core of these two tags grow and the pattern of individual expression through cultural value forms. We began to notice that all of the objects had individual significance and cultural significance through analyzing this pattern. However, after reading the descriptions of the edges connecting the objects to both of these nodes, we realized that all of the objects’ functions of individual expression and cultural value are different. Observing this phenomenon has helped us to better answer our research question. 

## A conclusion

A conclusion about how Network analysis together with the research you did on your individual objects helped you answer your research question.
