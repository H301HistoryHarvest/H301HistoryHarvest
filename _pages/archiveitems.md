Each of the historical artifacts below is drawn from an archive in the Bloomington area. Its presence in this exhibit is inspired by one of the items gathered as students in our class [wrote their own histories]({{ site.baseurl }}/stories/) in preparation for our class [History Harvest]({{ site.baseurl }}/items/).
