# Mapping
Mapping of data can help us to find or illustrate patterns of that data spatially.  Through our mapping we can tell more complete stories and make better informed arguments about our data.  For our History Harvest, we used Clio to help tell our objects' stories.





In the “who, when, where, how” questions of history, historical mapping data gets at the heart of answering the “where”. Location in space is not just something that’s important for large-scale events such battles and disasters, it’s also important for understanding the daily life of ordinary people. For our History Harvest, we used Clio to help tell the stories of our objects. By mapping out in space where our objects came from and displaying objects within their original context, we can learn more about what locations mean a lot when it comes to defining Hoosier life and why.

Historical objects can be defined through their production and connection to a specific locale. Items and artifacts like a collection of family recipies, an heirloom, a property deed, or a section of a mural are defined by their relationship to their environment. When were they created? Where and by who? What relationships were they associated with in this place or places? Mapping data is very helpful in visualizing the spatial placement of objects and events over time. Collecting items and testimony connected to a place gives us the mapping data. With the mapping data, we can create dynamic visualizations like story maps that tell larger stories of place, community, and change over time.
