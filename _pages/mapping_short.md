# Mapping
Mapping of data can help us to find or illustrate patterns of that data spatially.  Through our mapping we can tell more complete stories and make better informed arguments about our data.  For our History Harvest, we used Google My Maps to help tell our objects' stories.

In the “who, when, where, how” questions of history, historical mapping data gets at the heart of answering the “where”. Location in space is not just something that’s important for large-scale events such battles and disasters, it’s also important for understanding the daily life of ordinary people. For our History Harvest, we used Google My Maps to help tell the stories of our objects. By mapping out in space where our objects came from and displaying objects within their original context, we can learn more about what locations mean a lot when it comes to defining Hoosier life and why.
