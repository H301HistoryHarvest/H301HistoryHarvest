# Text Analysis
Text analysis in digital humanities allows researchers to systematically assess datasets for information extraction when answering or forming their research questions. Text analysis methods in the digital humanities may entail approaches such as text frequency analysis, allocating relative values to key terms, and discerning patterns over given windows of time. This approach to the study of sources can allow for the development of more nuanced and structured understandings of a given textâ€™s authorial intent or thematic structure. Text analysis can be especially important in the digital humanities when researching textxs lacking systematic structure or standardized formats. Researchers can employ a variety of open source tools for beginning their text analysis, such as Voyant and MALLET.
