# Text Analysis
Text analysis, or data mining, allows us to read texts in new ways.  The method may include many ways of statistically analyzing a corpus.    In our History Harvest project, we used Voyant to build word clouds and other interactive visualizations that illustrate for the reader the frequencies of words gathered in the oral histories of harvested objects.
