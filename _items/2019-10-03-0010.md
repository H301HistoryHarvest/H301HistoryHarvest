## About This Item

The secondary source ties to my item because it can be used to understand the cultural differences between Soviet Union Kyrgyzstan and Soviet Union. It explains cultural distinctions and preservation of culture in countries that were in the USSR. It also explains how these differences were not so stark and how some values were preserved from countries like Kyrgyzstan and how some individuals adhered more to USSR values. It’s a bit of a stretch for my item but I believe it is necessary to understand Soviet interactions in this area of the world that the item came from and how interesting it is that it still exists.

The secondary source might help me see a connection with the IU Archives item. I need to know more about the history of it. However, I would like to see the item through the lens of the secondary source- how this item withstands cultural differences and political changeover. If this doesn’t pan out, I might have to use the second and third primary sources listed. These would pertain more to seeing the item within a household.

## From the Contributor

I met it before I came to the US because I wanted to bring something cultural from my home country to show people here but similar items I used to see in my grandma’s house when I was a kid but now I don’t see them anymore because everything is getting very modern and people they’re becoming more, I don’t know, modern or just they’re losing the identity I guess I would say, culture. So it really reminds me [of] my grandma’s house and things that my grandma used to do so I just got it like in summer recently but yeah, I just wanted to show the cultural item of my home country.
