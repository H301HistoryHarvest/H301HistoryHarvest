## About This Item

The secondary source "Stress Goes to the Dogs" makes a connection to the object through the ties of canine companionship and social psychology. [The benefits of dogs](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-10-health-benefits-of-dogs-and-one-health-risk_n_57dad1b8e4b04a1497b2f5a0) might be obvious to their owners. However, some of the most knowledgeable owners might be surprised to find out that “…the presence of a canine comrade acts as a natural sedative for its human master, lowering blood pressure and other bodily responses to stress…”


In ties between the secondary source, Malachi the Dog, and the primary source, I found a connection between the development of both man and dog. In a collaborative working sense, the herding dogs of yesterday are now the drug sniffing, police, guide dogs of today. All while maintaining the title of “man’s best friend.”

## From the Contributor

Malachi the Dog is symbolic of many transitions in the owner's life. The first being a physical move. Malachi was adopted the day after Krista moved into her new apartment. This, in turn, morphed into a transition within itself as Malachi prompted Krista to be more active, social, and helped her find a new place within the Bloomington community.
