## About This Item

My secondary source ties to my object because it explains how dorodango was researched during the 1990’s to learn more about child psychology and education. This source emphasizes play as child development in relation to the creation of mudballs, and illustrates the benefits of using mudballs to learn about Earth, creativity, meditation and oneself. This connects to the object because the object’s owner explains its significance by connecting the object to art education and learning. The secondary source gave more light to how mudballs are a good tool for playing as development. 

My secondary source helps me see a connection between my object and the primary source I found because my primary source is a series of correspondence and manuscripts from a Professor at IU who emphasized the importance of play as development in childhood education and my object, mudballs, were used by an art teacher to teach his students about art, nature, and as a means of comfort. The object provides a real-life example of mudballs used in education, the secondary source provides research about mudballs as play as development, and the primary source provides the big picture of play as development: information on why play as development is important in childhood education. 

## From the Contributor

This is a collection of mudballs built over 25 years of teaching children that they can manipulate materials in order *to make art and bring them comfort.*
