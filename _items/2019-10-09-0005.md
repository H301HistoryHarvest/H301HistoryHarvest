## About This Item

The Gorn first makes its appearance in an episode of Star Trek called “Arena” (1967) in which Captain Kirk finds himself battling the captain of a Gorn Spaceship to the death as a result of being taken by the Metrons. A physically dominant alien, the Gorn and Captain Kirk trade blows and fight until Kirk defeats him with a home-made bazooka cannon. The only way to defeat the alien was with a technologically superior move.

Both men and women began to wear the boots for fashion purposes, claiming the misuse of the boots intended purpose for their own, as a choice of character [Find out more and browse here](https://www.timberland.com). This specific wave, transforming the Timberland Boots into a fashion icon, is one of the first widespread intentional misuse of a fashion piece for cultural or stylistic reasoning.

## From the Contributor

The Gorn symbolizes a special inside joke that he has with his mom/family. What started as a silly interpretation has become a running gag in the family that has evolved into something physical. The painting brings a smile to the contributor’s face whenever he sees it and reminds him of a special memory.
